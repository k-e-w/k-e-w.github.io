Things Vivi likes in order of deliciousness:

1. Her hands
  
2. Jonathan&#8217;s sandwich
  
3. Easter eggs

At three months, Vivi has also delighted us all by:
  
1. Imitating Mr. Burns (Excellent, Smithers!)
  
2. Wearing her mom&#8217;s hip shirts from the late 70&#8217;s
  
3. Growing like a weed
