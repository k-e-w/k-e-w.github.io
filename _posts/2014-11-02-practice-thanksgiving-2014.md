## What it&#8217;s about

We have a lot to be grateful for, and we’d like to share that.

The Practice Thanksgiving concept is pretty simple: Thanksgiving is awesome. Double Thanksgiving is twice as awesome. _It’s math_. So, per the secret rules of the hardcore Thanksgiving underground, we do a Practice Thanksgiving with our friends. That’s you.

We’ll do a fresh local bird (or two), lovingly brined and stuffed full of sage and parsley and goodness. You lot will pitch in with the full flower of your creativity on the sides, drinks and desserts. Experimentation is encouraged. Please keep it simple, bring serving spoons and portion to share.

Your friends, family and kids are welcome to join us.
