A quick update on what I&#8217;m doing. I recently retired from Global Integrity with my best wishes to them. Nathaniel kindly recapped my time at Global Integrity on the[ Global Integrity Commons](http://www.globalintegrity.org/blog/hail-and-farewell-jonathan).

It was ten years to the month since I started, and time to step out, particularly to connect with folks in Chicago. So I&#8217;m working on two projects at the moment, one based here in Chicago, another with folks all over the globe.

The first is as director of the Chicago Summit Project at **Community Media Workshop**, providing [reporting resources for the G8 and NATO summits](http://www.chicagostories.org) to be held in Chicago this May. I&#8217;m working with the Workshop to help media cover those events in a way that brings in deep, solution-oriented discussion of the social justice issues on the official and unofficial event agendas. Less people on podiums, more storytelling around how these issues &#8212; security, food, economies &#8212; impact people and what we could do differently. We&#8217;re going to play with some cool crowd-engagement tools, and figure out how to tell a really fast moving story in a useful way.

The second is the [Social Tech Census](https://www.theengineroom.org/?post_type=projects&p=283) with **the engine room**, a startup consultancy with staff in Cairo. The engine room aims to help advocacy organizations find and deploy appropriate technology. The Social Tech Census is a project to understand the global landscape of training organizations, and figure out who is most interesting, influential and worth emulating. To do this, we&#8217;re going to collect a bunch of survey data, and build a list of orgs, but with an eye to building social graphs of institutions and track who looks where for information.

I&#8217;m also open to future projects, particularly after this summer, when these wrap up. Thank you to everyone who has helped me recently figure out what to do next. I&#8217;m not sure what the destination is, but I&#8217;m moving fast and have good people to travel with. Thanks for that.

Cheers,

Jonathan
