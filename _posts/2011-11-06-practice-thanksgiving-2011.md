Hi folks &#8212;

<img class="alignright" title="Cranberry Can" src="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cranberry_can.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="265" />

We&#8217;re doing Practice Thanksgiving again this year, after a year off last year for the baby-having. You&#8217;re invited!

The Practice Thanksgiving concept is pretty simple: Thanksgiving is awesome. Double Thanksgiving is twice as awesome. _It&#8217;s math_. So, per the secret rules of a tradition which has been simmering along in the hardcore Thanksgiving sub-culture for a decade now, we do a Practice Thanksgiving with our friends. That&#8217;s you.

We&#8217;ll do a fresh local bird, lovingly brined and stuffed full of sage and parsley and goodness. You lot will pitch in with the full flower of your creativity on the sides, drinks and desserts. Portion to share with friends; experimentation is encouraged and failure is lovingly heckled. (For the record, you _can_ put bacon in pie, but in hindsight, it should probably be cooked beforehand).

Your friends and kids are welcome to join us.

**Schedule:** Next Sunday, 11/13/11! Gather at _4pm or later_ to cook and hang with kids. _Dinner served at 6pm._**
  
** **RSVP:** leave a comment on this post. Please note any food restrictions, or send an email if you prefer.

With thanks for many good things,

Jonathan, Kate, Vivian

HEADCOUNT: ~ 17 talls, 3 toddlers.

## The menu:

Bringing food is optional but encouraged. **Volunteer to bring something specific** **by leaving a comment** below this post, and I&#8217;ll update the list &#8212; we do it this way so you can see what&#8217;s claimed and we don&#8217;t get 12 yam recipes. Some **recommendations are in italics**, but feel free to improvize. If you can make something vegetarian, please do so.
