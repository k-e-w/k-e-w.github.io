At the moment WordPress sites worldwide are [under attack by a botnet](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/) that is attempting to guess admin passwords. If you admin a WordPress site, please update your password to something over 20 characters and install the Limit Login Attempts and Better WordPress Security plugins.

But this isn&#8217;t a WordPress issue. It&#8217;s an Internet issue, one that can be defeated by some simple password practices. The attack is a brute force attack trying common passwords, most of which are dictionary terms of 8 characters or less.

So don&#8217;t use short passwords.

The best way I&#8217;ve come up with to not use short passwords is to _stop memorizing passwords._

Instead, use an encrypted password vault with a single master passphrase. My favorite for this is [passpack.com](https://www.passpack.com).

Passpack is ideal for small teams because it allows secure sharing across teams at the per-password level. So an Adwords account gets shared with the group Marketing, and three other people now have access to only that password. Access can be revoked later (although you&#8217;ll want to change the password regardless). Small teams are free forever, bigger teams are totally reasonable (you can admin 15 users for $4 a month).

Once you have that in place, you are now copy/pasting blind chunks of text, which means you can use the &#8220;Suggest Password&#8221; tool to generate 30 digit random strings, which are effectively unguessable without direct access to the hardware.

Now you only remember one sentence-length passphrase (such as song lyrics + your childhood phone number) and everything else gets a very complex, never reused password. It&#8217;s more secure, and it&#8217;s also a lot easier than actually remembering all your passwords.
