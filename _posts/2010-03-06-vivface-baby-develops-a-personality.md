Hi folks!

Vivi has hit the one month mark, so Jonathan and I are now EXPERTS on
  
parenting! Hooray! Exciting milestones for this month (documented in
  
the photo slide show linked below) include:

**Emoting**! Vivi can make all kinds of hilarious faces.

**Generational Continuity!** We drove on up to Wisco to introduce Vivian
  
to her great-grandmother Alice. Note the excellent &#8220;4 generations
  
shot.&#8221; We are still taking votes on who she looks most like. I think
  
she got her daddy&#8217;s nose, and she definitely got my dimpled chin.

**The Endurance!** Our excellent stroller dominates the icy conditions of
  
the sidewalks. Also, it is huge. We have dubbed it The HMS Endurance
  
(although we don&#8217;t anticipate having to live on seals for three
  
years). The best part about strolling the baby around is that you have
  
to put a blanket over the seat to protect her against sun/wind/cold,
  
which means that if she starts wiggling around and crying it looks
  
like you have a magic crying afghan.

**Playing With the Baby!** Mostly this involves having her snooze on our
  
laps while we read or work. But sometimes she keeps her eyes open long
  
enough to stare at black and white pictures, and man oh man does she
  
enjoy that.

**Achieving an Evening Outing**, or **Embarrassing Vivi in Public**! We
  
actually made it out into the adult social world this weekend. Our
  
friend Rachel manages a swanky wine store and we attended her tasting/
  
food pairing event which involved a lobster/roast beef/avocado club
  
sandwich, popcorn popped in rendered duck fat, and a giant 9 liter
  
bottle of wine. One of the tastings involved a wine with a mustache on
  
the label, so we all got fake mustaches with entirely predictable
  
results. Our fellow attendees enjoyed seeing a tiny baby out, and she
  
was easy as pie. Success!

Much love,
  
Kate and Jonathan and Vivian
