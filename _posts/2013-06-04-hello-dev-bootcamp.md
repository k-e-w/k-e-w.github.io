The _Chicago Tribune_&#8216;s Walin Wong [describes Dev Bootcamp](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-03/business/chi-dev-bootcamp-coming-to-chicago-next-spring-20121203_1_starter-league-obtiva-code-academy) thusly:

> Dev Bootcamp, begun in San Francisco in February [2012], offers nine weeks of full-time, intensive training in professional Web development. Students do not need prior experience in software development; the program&#8217;s goal is for graduates to have enough knowledge to join a company as an entry-level developer. Dev Bootcamp organizes hiring days where technology companies interview students. The company said it has placed 95 percent of its San Francisco graduates with average starting annual salaries of more than $85,000.

There are many things I like about this school, which I&#8217;ll share in time. For now, sufficient to say I am very excited to join the team, starting tomorrow.
