Kringle is a holiday treat that my mother&#8217;s family would cook in the wintertime. For many years, this thin slab of homemade pastry would provide the calories required for a hyperactive Christmas morning. It&#8217;s easy to make, highly portable, and covered in icing &#8212; in other words, pretty much perfect.

For this reason, I always assumed that tinkering with my grandmother Alice&#8217;s Kringle recipe was akin to remixing Thriller &#8212; it&#8217;s never going to be as good, so why would you?

Then, there was the butter incident. The recipe calls for margarine. I don&#8217;t use much margarine myself, so I was caught short of the two sticks required and had to wing it. So I just used butter.

And it was… _good_. Possibly even… _better_.

For years, that&#8217;s as far as I went. I kept using butter. I didn&#8217;t talk about it. Alice&#8217;s Kingle recipe was codified in a family cookbook I helped edit, the King James Bible of the family recipe boxes. But I had sampled the apple filling of knowledge, and it could not be undone. I started to wonder if other aspects of Kringle could be tinkered with. I played with the dough. I tried some new fillings. I started to take notes, add to the canon. I was hacking Grandma&#8217;s Kringle.

And here&#8217;s the thing about hacking… hacking makes stuff better. And sharable. And delicious. And at the end of the day, this is where the first Kringle came from. Then I found out that everyone else was using butter too&#8230; but not mentioning it.

You may now insert [here] your own rant about how America is still a country that makes things, but only if we actually hack and share and post pictures of pastries on the Internet. When you&#8217;re done with that, here&#8217;s what I figured out about Kringle in [my variation of Alice&#8217;s recipe](http://www.eylerwerve.com/2011/kringle-2-0/).

The King James edition is published in the cookbook _[Alice&#8217;s Kitchen](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/alices-kitchen/1460663?productTrackingContext=search_results/search_shelf/center/3)_, a free [PDF download](http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_71/11554000/11554334/1/print/1071718_alice_v14.pdf).
