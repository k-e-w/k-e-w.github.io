We have a lot to be grateful for, and we&#8217;d like to share that.

The Practice Thanksgiving concept is pretty simple: Thanksgiving is awesome. Double Thanksgiving is twice as awesome. _It&#8217;s math_. So, per the secret rules of the hardcore Thanksgiving underground, we do a Practice Thanksgiving with our friends. That&#8217;s you.

This year, Kate and Jonathan are happy to co-host with Ariel Diamond, a fabulous butcher and baker and food writer. This has _implications_ for _dinner_.

We&#8217;ll do a fresh local bird, lovingly brined and stuffed full of sage and parsley and goodness. You lot will pitch in with the full flower of your creativity on the sides, drinks and desserts. Experimentation is encouraged. Keep it simple and portion to share.

Your friends, family and kids are welcome to join us.

**Schedule:** Sunday, 11/4/2012. 3:00pm (remember to Fall Back).

Gather at 3pm. Food starts at 4pm sharp. Note new schedule: Less milling about, more eating.

**RSVP:** Leave a comment on this post. Please note any food restrictions, or send an email if you prefer.

With thanks for many good things,

Jonathan, Kate, Vivian and Ariel
