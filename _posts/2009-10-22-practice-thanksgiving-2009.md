 ****We actually don&#8217;t remember who started it. About a decade ago, a twenty-something friend of a friend of a friend was hosting Thanksgiving for her family. Not willing to submit her family to a potential culinary disaster, she did a full dress rehersal a few weeks before. With all this good food, she invited her friends over to eat it all, where they all learned a very important lesson: Thanksgiving is awesome. Doing it twice is _twice as awesome_. Practice Thanksgiving was born: it&#8217;s like Thanksgiving, but with your friends. Today, the San Francisco Practice Thanksgiving is a three-bird annual Big Deal. Last year we brought it to Chicago &#8211; big dinner, lots of family recipes, good people, some wine. You are kindly invited to join us again for PT 2009.

Co-hosts: Jonathan Eyler-Werve, Kate Eyler-Werve

This is, should you desire, a participatory event! **Kindly RSVP by commenting on this page below**, with submissions on what culinary masterpiece (or near miss) you would like to create.Â  Low effort contributions like a jug o&#8217; cider are also totally welcome! No remorseful self-flagellation by non-cooks required &#8212; just show up and eat.

We&#8217;ll edit a running list on this page so we don&#8217;t get 14 versions of mashed potatoes. Points will be awarded for degree of difficulty, Thanksgiving kitsch factor, and delightfulness. THERE WILL BE PRIZES. Make it work, people.
