In 2008 a writer, Kevin Kelly, published a [hypothesis](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php): that creators don’t need to be widely known to be successful. Instead, they need a core group of 1000 true fans, willing to provide regular, significant support. 1000 fans x $100 = $100,000 a year, before expenses. The idea is wildly popular &#8211; in theory. In practice, very few people have made this work by selling downloads and t-shirts.

Our revision: patronage of public goods, not sales of private goods, is the future of creative work. Networked creativity is crippled by a legal and commercial paradigm which treats computer files as vital resources and people as replaceable. Backwards. Wrong.

Thousand True, independent of and grateful to Kelly, aims to transform creative work by enabling a new funding model: micropatronage. Our creators, working in music, the arts, literature, journalism, social activism and technology, will ask their patrons to join them in a creative community; a dialogue.

Today, would-be patrons of creative work are faced with the devil’s choice of piracy or fueling ancient monopolies that also punish artists. We’re offering a way out, one which celebrates creators, builds deep communities, and enables the creation of open, sharable culture.

We’re starting. [You can join us.](http://www.thousandtrue.com/join)
