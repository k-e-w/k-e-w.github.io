Hi folks!

Thank you all for the many kind emails, SMS messages and calls. We all feel very loved, and we very much appreciate the many fine people who will help raise our little rugrat. Now, before my family revolts on me, I&#8217;ve uploaded the photos from the last three days (three!? it feels like thirty).

Baby and mother are doing well, and we had our first outing (to the doctor) in a driving snowstorm. That&#8217;s granddaddy&#8217;s car, if you&#8217;re wondering. We&#8217;ll be fitting Vivian for her first bike any day now.

Kate&#8217;s parents made it in before the snow hit, and Grandaddy Ed is making us _[choucroute garnie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choucroute_garnie)_, which is French for mmmmmmmmmmm. Main ingredients: sausage, sauerkraut, butter, gin. 

Much love,
  
Jonathan
