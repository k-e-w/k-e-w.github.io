Hey kids! It&#8217;s time for the 5th annual Eyler-Werve Practice Thanksgiving!

The Practice Thanksgiving concept is pretty simple: Thanksgiving is awesome. Double Thanksgiving is twice as awesome. _It’s math_. So, per the secret rules of the hardcore Thanksgiving underground, we do a potluck Practice Thanksgiving with our friends. That’s you.

We are co-hosting with Ariel Diamond, a fabulous butcher and baker and food writer. This has _implications_ for _dinner_.

We’ll do a fresh local bird, lovingly brined and stuffed full of sage and parsley and goodness. You lot will pitch in with the full flower of your creativity on the sides, drinks and desserts. Experimentation is encouraged. Keep it simple and portion to share.

Your friends, family and kids are welcome to join us. Last year we had a zillion kiddos bouncing around and it was pretty rad.

**Schedule:** Sunday, 11/10/2013. 3:00pm.

Gather at 3pm. Food starts at 4pm sharp. Note new schedule: Less milling about, more eating. Last year we topped out at 50 people, which means some people didn&#8217;t get bread, so for heaven&#8217;s sake get here on time!

**RSVP:** Leave a comment on this post. Please note any food restrictions, or send an email if you prefer.

With thanks for many good things,

Jonathan, Kate, Vivian and Ariel
