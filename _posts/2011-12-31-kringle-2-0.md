A recipe for a delightful German pastry. Makes two to three large pastries. Kringle 2.0 has a pastry crust and is pictured on the left. Original recipe Kringle is on the far right. The origin and tweaking of this recipe is <a href="/2011/hacking-kringle/">discussed in another post</a>.

### Shopping list

  * unsalted butter
  * sour cream (16 oz. tub)
  * Solo pastry/cake filling (apricot, cherry, raspberry, cherry, almond&#8230;)

### Make the dough

Warm butter to near room temperature.[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-684" title="blog-kingle-3" src="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3-300x179.jpg 300w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3-1024x612.jpg 1024w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3-226x135.jpg 226w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-3.jpg)

You&#8217;re about to combine the following in a mixing bowl:

  * Two sticks unsalted butter
  * Two cups flour
  * 8oz (half a tub) sour cream
  * dash salt

Cut the butter into the flour in quarter sized lumps with a knife or pastry cutter. Stir in the sour cream and salt. With a little mixing, you&#8217;ll get a somewhat uniform mass of dough.

    Layers.

You&#8217;re ready to start folding. Lump it into a ball and mash it flat between the heels of your hand. Fold it in half (or quarters), aiming for a shape similar to your original ball. Mash it flat again. Repeat 15 times. Try to keep the layers parallel, so they stack on top of each other. Each time you do, you double the number of layers &#8212; after 15 folds, you should have a 2^15 layers (65,536) give or take a thousand. In food terms, this is now a light, flaky crust.

Wrap the folded dough ball in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight or at least 4 hours. You want the internal temperature of the dough to be cold &#8212; below 50* F &#8212; or it gets sticky and screws up your layers.

### Make the pastry

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-685" title="blog-kingle-4" src="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-4-179x300.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="300" />

Preheat oven to 375* F.

Leave the dough in the fridge and get your workspace ready. You&#8217;ll need

  * flour,
  * rolling surface,
  * rolling pin,
  * one can of Solo pastry filling,
  * cookie sheet coated very lightly with high-temp cooking oil.

Throw flour on hands, rolling pin, surface.

After you&#8217;re set up, grab the dough from the fridge. Cut the ball in half or thirds with a knife &#8212; top to bottom, across the layers &#8212; and return the unused dough to the fridge. The idea is to keep the dough cold until you&#8217;re ready to roll it.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-686" title="blog-kingle-5" src="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blog-kingle-5-179x300.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="300" />

Use your hands to squeeze the dough into a small lump the shape of a shoebox, with the layers flat against the tabletop. Gently roll into a rectangular sheet, roughly 2&#8217;x1&#8242; and a quarter inch thick. You want square edges, so fold any thin rounded edges over to make a rectangle.

Spoon Solo filling into the middle third of the Kringle, on the long axis. You&#8217;ll use one can (or less) for all of your dough, but you don&#8217;t have to use the whole can. Popular filling flavors are cherry, raspberry, apricot. You can also use almond (which tastes like a nutty cherry).

Fold the narrow ends over, then fold Kringle shut by sealing the two outside flaps together. Pinch the edges together or they will open during cooking. Push down any stray corners or edges, which will burn.

Bake for 35-40 minutes until Golden Brown Delicious.

Remove from baking sheet immediately. As it cools, drizzle with icing. Make icing by mixing a big tablespoon of powdered sugar mixed with a tiny splash of milk or cream in a measuring cup.
