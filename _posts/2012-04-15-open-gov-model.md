[Governments](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries) are starting to change the way they catch and release data. The giant file cabinets are still there, of course, but when the [head of government starts pushing](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment) open data the wheels start to turn. The shift away from file cabinets towards open data driving government is essentially a change management issue. But most open government conversations don&#8217;t approach the problem as an institutional development or change management problem. Instead, we hear about &#8220;apps&#8221; and &#8220;transparency&#8221; and &#8220;participation&#8221;, all of which have definitional baggage.

Fortunately, lots of smart people have studied how organizations change, which means open government data proponents have a wealth of change management research to build a new change model on. I&#8217;m taking a crack at it here.

In this post, I&#8217;m proposing a change model based on the Dunphy Sustainability Scale, a tool for understanding how organizations adopt sustainability values. The environmental and social sustainability movement is a particularly good starting point for us because it has many parallels to open government:

  * Most organizations class both sustainability and open data practices as &#8220;nice to have,&#8221; not &#8220;core to the business.&#8221;
  * Both sustainability and open data can be transformational; they can create an entirely new frame to consider what an organization can achieve and how it operates.
  * There aren&#8217;t many organizations that have managed to transform themselves yet, although there are plenty that are working on it.

It also helps that [I&#8217;ve spent a few years working on sustainability](http://www.eylerwerve.com/kate/) focused change management projects, so I have a working understanding of the different stages, which I&#8217;ve drawn out here:[<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1018" title="Open Data and Government: A Change Model" src="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1-590x442.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1-590x442.jpg 590w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1-226x169.jpg 226w, http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1.jpg 960w" />](http://www.eylerwerve.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Slide1.jpg)

Let&#8217;s dig in, starting from the bottom:

  1. **Rejection:** Pretty self explanatory, really. This is a government that actively refuses to take steps towards opening data.
  2. **No Response:** This is a government that isn&#8217;t actively refusing to take action but isn&#8217;t making any positive effort either.
  3. **Compliance:** If regulations require opening data, these governments will do the bare minimum.
  4. **Efficiency:** At this stage someone is making strategic decisions about what data to open in order to save the government time or money.
  5. **City as platform:** Providing clean, structured data is the default; withholding data is the exception.

Of course, naming the stages is the easy part. The real question is: how do you move a government up the scale?

It&#8217;s easy to see how to move a government from rejection to compliance &#8211; just pass a law! While we&#8217;re waiting for the policy people to stop laughing, let&#8217;s take a closer look at the second half of the scale.

**Apps contests as change agents**

In an upcoming O&#8217;Reilly manual I&#8217;m writing with Virginia Carlson, I&#8217;m going to explore how civic apps competitions can move governments from _compliance_ to _efficiency_ and from _efficiency_ to _city as platform_.

A common critique of civic apps competitions is that the apps don&#8217;t last. This is usually true, but there are other good outcomes of a apps competition that may be more important. Apps contests are a way to push government along the progression from _rejection_ to _city as platform_. While apps for finding pickup basketball or cheap parking are nice, the long term transformation of government is a more permanent and wider reaching outcome.

Change management studies tell us there are four outcomes that make change stick:

  1. **Examples (I see it):** Show what success looks like.
  2. **Assessment (I need it):** Show how the change will make my work life better.
  3. **Practice (I do it):** Get started.
  4. **Support (I live it):** Build a community of people who support the change.

  A well designed and well run civic apps competition can make those things happen in three key ways:
</div>

  * **Community building:** Competitions engage the coding community with government data, which creates a community that supports the change to city as platform.
  * **Proof of Concept apps:** Competition apps are examples that demonstrate the usefulness of making government data public to businesses and NGOs  &#8211; even if they don&#8217;t stand alone after the competition ends.
  * **Test drive data practices:** Competitions frequently speed the development of clean and structured data, which provides practice.

Compared to a nice, solid app these outcomes might seem pretty intangible, but that&#8217;s because the learning process is a nebulous thing. Institutional development is hard to see, but has long lasting impact.
